              Growing up in the mountains of <b className="purple">Guizhou</b> as a member of the <b className="purple">Miao ethnic minority</b>, 
              I was immersed in the rich cultural heritage of my community, such as Miao batik and embroidery. 
              Observing efforts to promote our culture through English signs and maps, 
              I realized that more could be done to make <b className="purple">Miao culture</b> accessible to a broader audience. 
              This realization inspired me to explore how <b className="purple">technology</b> could <b className="purple">bridge cultural gaps</b> and <b className="purple">share our heritage with the world</b>.
              <br />
              <br />
              Driven by my deep-rooted interest in cultural exchange and language, I focused on understanding diverse cultures and their expressions.
              I transitioned from a Bachelor of Arts in English and a minor in Finance to pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Northeastern University.
              My academic journey has provided me with a <b className="purple">multidisciplinary perspective</b>, enriching my approach to problem-solving in the tech industry. 
              Currently, I am focusing on building my expertise in software development and am <b className="purple">actively seeking opportunities for a 2025 summer/fall internship in software development or related fields</b>, where I can contribute to innovative and impactful projects.
              <br />
              <br />
              With a heart open to learning and a mind brimming with ideas, 
              I am ready to dive into the <b className="purple">Tech</b> world.
